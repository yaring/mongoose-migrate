## mongoose-migrate

Node.js migration framework that uses MongoDB to keep track of migrations.

This is a fork of [madhums/mongoose-migrate](https://github.com/madhums/mongoose-migrate) with two changes:

* Eliminate the need to configure Mongoose schema and model name. Model is automatically named `Migration`.
* Config file is a Node module. This enables things like reading database URLs from environment variables instead of hard-coding in the JSON file.

## Configuration

Create a config file with one database URL for each node environment, i.e. `process.env.NODE_ENV`.

```js
// Path : ./migrations/config.js
module.exports = {
  development : devDbUrl,
  test        : testDbUrl,
  production  : prodDbUrl
}
```

## Usage

```sh
$ MIGRATION_CONFIG_PATH=./migrations/config.js mongoose-migrate [options] [command]

Options:

   -c, --chdir <path>   change the working directory

Commands:

   down             migrate down
   up               migrate up (default)
   create [title]   create a new migration file with optional [title]
```

## Creating Migrations

To create a migration, execute `mongoose-migrate create` with an optional title. `mongoose-migrate` will create a node module within `./migrations/` which contains the following two exports:

    exports.up = function(next){
      next();
    };

    exports.down = function(next){
      next();
    };

All you have to do is populate these, invoking `next()` when complete, and you are ready to migrate!

For example:

    $ migrate create add-pets
    $ migrate create add-owners

The first call creates `./migrations/{timestamp in milliseconds}-add-pets.js`, which we can populate:

      var db = require('./db');

      exports.up = function(next){
        db.rpush('pets', 'tobi');
        db.rpush('pets', 'loki');
        db.rpush('pets', 'jane', next);
      };

      exports.down = function(next){
        db.rpop('pets');
        db.rpop('pets');
        db.rpop('pets', next);
      };

The second creates `./migrations/{timestamp in milliseconds}-add-owners.js`, which we can populate:

      var db = require('./db');

      exports.up = function(next){
        db.rpush('owners', 'taylor');
        db.rpush('owners', 'tj', next);
      };

      exports.down = function(next){
        db.rpop('owners');
        db.rpop('owners', next);
      };

## Running Migrations

When first running the migrations, all will be executed in sequence.

    $ migrate
    up : migrations/1316027432511-add-pets.js
    up : migrations/1316027432512-add-jane.js
    up : migrations/1316027432575-add-owners.js
    up : migrations/1316027433425-coolest-pet.js
    migration : complete

Subsequent attempts will simply output "complete", as they have already been executed in this machine. `mongoose-migrate` knows this because it stores the current state in MongoDB.

    $ migrate
    migration : complete

If we were to create another migration using `mongoose-migrate create`, and then execute migrations again, we would execute only those not previously executed:

    $ migrate
    up : migrates/1316027433455-coolest-owner.js

You can also run migrations incrementally by specifying a migration.

    $ migrate up 1316027433425-coolest-pet.js
    up : migrations/1316027432511-add-pets.js
    up : migrations/1316027432512-add-jane.js
    up : migrations/1316027432575-add-owners.js
    up : migrations/1316027433425-coolest-pet.js
    migration : complete

This will run up-migrations upto (and including) `1316027433425-coolest-pet.js`. Similarly you can run down-migrations upto (and including) a specific migration, instead of migrating all the way down.

    $ migrate down 1316027432512-add-jane.js
    down : migrations/1316027432575-add-owners.js
    down : migrations/1316027432512-add-jane.js
    migration : complete
